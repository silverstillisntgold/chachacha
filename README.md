# ChaChaCha: ChaCha with a little extra Cha

Extremely fast chacha implementation. Primarily made for use in the [`ya-rand`] crate, but should
be just as usable anywhere else you might want to use Chacha.

Documentation is minimal at the moment (working on it), and the public API needs significant
improvement (it's kind of dogshit right now).
